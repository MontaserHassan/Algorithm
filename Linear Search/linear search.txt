Linear Search is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element of a list until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

How Linear Search Works: 

    1- Start from the first element of the array.
    2- Compare the current element with the target value.
    3- If they match, return the index of the element.
    4- If they don't match, move to the next element.
    5- Repeat the process until the target is found or the array ends.
    6- If the target is not found, return -1.
