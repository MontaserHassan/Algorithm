Binary search is a search algorithm that works efficiently on sorted data. It follows a divide-and-conquer approach, repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half; otherwise, it continues in the right half.

Binary Search Algorithm: 

    1- Start with the entire array.
    2- Compute the middle index.
    3- Compare the middle element with the target value:
        1. If equal, return the index.
        2. If the target is less, update the search range to the left half.
        3. If the target is greater, update the search range to the right half.
    4- Repeat until the search range is empty or the target is found.
