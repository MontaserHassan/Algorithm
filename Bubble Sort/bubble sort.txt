Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.

How Bubble Sort Works: 

    1- Start at the beginning of the list.
    2- Compare the first two elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
    3- Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swapping process.
    4- Continue until the end of the list. After one pass, the largest element will "bubble up" to its correct position.
    5- Repeat the process for the remaining elements (excluding the last sorted ones) until the entire list is sorted.
