A swap algorithm is a simple technique to exchange the values of two variables. Swapping is commonly used in sorting algorithms and other algorithms where element positions need to be rearranged.

How Bubble Sort Works: 

    1- Start at the beginning of the list.
    2- Compare the first two elements. If the first is greater than the second, swap them.
    3- Move to the next pair of elements and repeat the comparison and swapping process.
    4- Continue until the end of the list. After one pass, the largest element will "bubble up" to its correct position.
    5- Repeat the process for the remaining elements (excluding the last sorted ones) until the entire list is sorted.
